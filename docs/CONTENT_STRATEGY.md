# Content Strategy: "The Tech Partner" Voice
**Focus:** Building Trust & Authority through "Problem-Solving" Content.

## 1. Brand Voice Guidelines
*   **From:** "I am a passionate coder who loves React." (Amateur)
*   **To:** "We build scalable digital infrastructure that drives business growth." (Professional)
*   **Tone:** Confident, Direct, Result-Oriented. Avoid passive voice.

## 2. Service Page Content Templates

### A. AI & Automation Page (`/services/ai-solutions`)
*   **H1 Headline:** "Automate Your Business with Custom AI Agents"
*   **The Problem:** "Stop wasting hours on manual customer support and data entry."
*   **The Solution:** "We integrate OpenAI and custom LLMs into your existing workflows to slash operational costs by 40%."
*   **Key Features:** Chatbots, Predictive Analytics, Auto-Generated Reports.
*   **Social Proof:** "Helping businesses process 10k+ requests daily."

### B. Custom Software Page (`/services/custom-software`)
*   **H1 Headline:** "Enterprise-Grade Web Applications, Built to Scale"
*   **The Problem:** "Off-the-shelf software doesn't fit your unique workflow."
*   **The Solution:** "Tailor-made SaaS platforms designed for your specific business logic."
*   **Tech Stack (The "How"):** React, Node.js, AWS (mentioned only as tools to achieve reliability).

## 3. Blog/Article Topics (Future)
These are titles we will eventually write to rank for long-tail keywords.
1.  *“How much does it cost to build a custom CRM in 2025?”*
2.  *“React vs. WordPress: Why growing startups need custom code.”*
3.  *“The ROI of updating your legacy software.”*

## 4. On-Page SEO Checklist (For every new page)
- [ ] **URL:** Clean, keyword-rich (e.g., `/services/mvp-development`).
- [ ] **Title Tag:** Key Benefit + Brand (e.g., "MVP Development for Startups | NashTech").
- [ ] **H1:** Matches the Title Tag intent.
- [ ] **First 100 Words:** Must include the primary keyword and the "User Pain Point".
- [ ] **Images:** Alt text must describe the business value (e.g., "Dashboard showing real-time sales analytics").
